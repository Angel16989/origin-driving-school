## Copyright Notice:
All images must be:
- Free for commercial use
- No attribution required (preferred)
- Or properly attributed in footer

## Current Status:
The site now streams high-resolution imagery directly from Unsplash using keyword-based URLs (see `index.php`, `gallery.php`, etc.).
- Every image can be replaced with your own hosted files by swapping the `src` attribute.
- Keep a local copy of final production assets inside the `images/` folders above for consistent branding and offline support.
