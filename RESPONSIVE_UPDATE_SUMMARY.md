# 🚗 Origin Driving School - Responsive Navigation Update

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Responsive Navigation Strategy**

#### 📱 **Mobile (≤768px):**
- **Single Page Scroll Approach** - All content (About, Services, Contact) accessible via smooth scrolling on main page
- **Hamburger Menu** - Mobile-friendly toggle navigation
- **Scroll Links** - About, Services, Contact use `#hash` anchors for in-page navigation
- **Separate Instructors Page** - Still accessible as separate page

#### 💻 **Desktop (>768px):**
- **Multi-Page Navigation** - Each section (About, Services, Contact, Instructors) is a separate page
- **Consistent Navigation** - All pages use same header with proper active state highlighting
- **Professional Layout** - Full-width navigation with all links visible

---

### 2. **New Pages Created**

✅ **about.php** - Dedicated About Us page
   - Our Story section
   - Mission, Values, Promise cards
   - Team stats (10+ years, 5000+ students, 98% pass rate)

✅ **services.php** - Comprehensive Services page
   - 6 service cards with detailed descriptions:
     1. Beginner's Course
     2. Intermediate Course
